// I'm gonna have to do some changes to NoteField to allow this to happen, but
// The idea is that ProxyField would be more optimized to use en masse compared to NoteFields, as this'd just copy what the field draws, rather than getting every pos etc itself
// Just need to figure out how I'm gonna write it tho
