// callbacks for mod loading incase you needa run some code when mod runs or whatever
// maybe to check incompats or smth, who knows lol
// if you have any other callbacks that might be useful then add them here
// idk if this'll be used, depends on how we load mods

// self callbacks (functions ran when the current mod has a status change)
function onInit(){} // ran when the mod is loading. You can return false if you want the mod to stop loading.
function onReady(){} // ran when the mod is ready and has been properly registered with the engine. It's resources are available to use, etc.

// other callbacks (functions ran when other mods have status changes when ran after this mod)
function onModInit(modId:String){} // ran when another mod is loading. You can return false if you want the mod to stop loading. Runs BEFORE the mod's own init function.
function onModReady(modId:String){} // ran when another mod is ready and has been properly registered with the engine. It's resources are available to use, etc.
