Subject to change!

Currently: Works similarly to minecraft resource packs
Put a folder with a name of the namespace. 
"troll_engine" is a built-in one which correlates to the engine's assets, so to override Troll Engine stuff you'd put it in the troll_engine folder
If you wanna replace another mod's assets you'd name it the namespace they use

Should allow mods more freedom esp. since you can now have multiple mods w/ the same song name as they'd be prefixed w/ the namespace in the save files etc
(so instead of it being saved as 'no-villains' its saved as 'tgt:no-villains')
You can also reference things from other mods by prefixing it with its namespace too i.e Paths.image("tgt:stage1/ground")

Dependencies means you can make the mod only run if other content exists, and will ensure this mod runs some time after them in the load order.

Speaking of load order, I wanna make a mod menu that lets you adjust mod load order similar to Minecraft resource packs menu
